# RewardsForTheWorthy
A simple addon that informs you whether you have a Transmutation Geode available to loot from a Rewards for the Worthy coffer, or how much time remains before your next one becomes available. Also sends an alert in the chat box when the cooldown is up and the next coffer will contain a Transmutation Geode.  Use the command /rftw to check how much time is left or to see if it is available.
